	- requirements
		- we must have extremely specific requirments before promising anything

	- which codebase to use?
		- decision: the 3, incorporate features from SDC teams
	- next.js vs expo?
		- PWA is a PITA

	- deployment
		- decision: RHEL first, AWS down the line
	- phase 2 - post deployment
