- we must have extremely specific requirments before promising anything
- get kris anne to fill out an APR
- deploy to RHEL at first, then AWS


- concerns
	- which codebase to use?
		- decision: ours, incorporate features from SDC teams
	- next.js vs expo?
		- PWA is a PITA
		- Expo would have better UX & stability
		- Expo can be deployed to iOS, Android, and Web
	- deployment
		- decision: RHEL first, AWS down the line

- future goal - easter moving forwards
	- bugs / features we bring in other people on the team to implement (other than the 3)
