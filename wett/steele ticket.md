Hi Cameron,

I can confirm your `Steele5221` account has access to these applications you've requested:
- MoneyCounts
- Archival / Historical Image Database
- Division Correspondence
- FIND
- Fuel/Vehicle
- Training History/Certificates/Awards
- Training [Calendar/Evaluation]

You also have access to:
- I&E
- Monthly Activity Report
- NRID
- Policies-Staff Directives/Guidelines
- Safety / EMS Resources
- Secondary Employment Approval
- The ID (Image Database-Scenics, Plants, Animals, etc.)
- Travel Authorization

We recently just spun off Equipment from Fuel/Vehicle/Equipment into its own application. The application owner (Michael Huffman) has asked us to postpone any new access requests during testing.

Are there any other applications you need access to?
