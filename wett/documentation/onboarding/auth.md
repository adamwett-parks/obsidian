# Your password
Your password is the same for both NCID and Microsoft accounts. I recommend setting your root password in WSL to this too.

# Login jargon
- NCID: usually first initial and last name, maybe a number
  - e.g. `awett` or `bliu2`
- Microsoft: usually first.last@ncparks.gov
  - e.g. `adam.wettreich@ncparks.gov`

# Wrong password
If you enter in your password incorrectly 3 times, you will be locked out of your account. If you mess up once, make sure you click 'show password' to see what you're typing in. If you mess up twice, good luck.

# Resetting your password
You can reset your password by going to the [NCID password reset page](https://www.ncid.nc.gov/PasswordReset/)
