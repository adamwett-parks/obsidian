Last Week
- V2
	- Discussed monorepo devops with Ian, he's going to dockerize for consistency across Windows & Linux
	- Built a reusable sidebar
- SDC
	- Lots of meetings
	- Split scope of project into two "phases"
	- **The Plan**
		- 2 teams, each based off same codebase
		- Phase 1: core
			- a11y, CRUD admin portal, trail stamps, improve filter & search, favorites, familiarize with service worker
		- Phase 2: extended
			- 100mi challenge, shared notes, push notifications, photo uploading, leaderboard
	- **Philosophy**
		- Phase 1 is expected to be completed and polished before beginning work on Phase 2
		- All Phase 1 objectives are mandatory, while teams can chose what & how much of Phase 2 they'd like to work on
		- Phase 1 is easier and more concrete

This Week
