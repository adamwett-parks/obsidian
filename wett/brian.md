Looking back on our project to optimize the lubrication system, I realize my most significant contributions weren't just in the technical calculations, but in navigating the human elements of teamwork. I found my most crucial role was acting as a mediator during our technical debates. When you get a group of smart, passionate people together, everyone has a strong, valid opinion on the best way forward. Things can get stuck when working on a team. I made it my goal to step back and listen to every perspective from my teammates and help guide us toward a consensus that combined the best from all our ideas. My strategy is about making sure we were arguing for the project and not just for our own concepts. This is what I believe made our final design so much stronger. In addition, there was the logistical challenge of the time difference. Being in Colorado, two hours behind the rest of the team near Clemson, took a serious amount of personal discipline. It forced me to be incredibly proactive with my scheduling and communication. I had to make sure I was always available and prepared whenever the team needed to meet. It wasn't easy, especially with work, but I was fully committed to pulling my weight and ensuring this didn't become an obstacle to our success. All in all, I think that this blend of diplomatic problem-solving and commitment to my team was the most valuable thing I brought to the table over the course of the project.
