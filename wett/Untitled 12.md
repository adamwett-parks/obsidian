Hi Daniel. I'm currently working at the NC Department of Parks & Recreation as a seasonal employee. My contract is up in June, with a minimum 35 day gap between working at the department.

In the meantime, I'm searching for roles elsewhere so I can continue the momentum of my career.

	- when the form is submitted? wastes user's time
	- when the form is changed? annoying, errors before user is finished filling out form
	- when the field is blurred? best UX, but messy event listeners
