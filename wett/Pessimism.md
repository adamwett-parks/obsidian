For the record, I think being a pessimist is, for lack of a better term, "gay and stupid".

I somewhat apologize for being rash there. I don't mean to offend. I don't apologize for being honest. This sentence might be even stupider and gayer than being a pessimist.

Everything important makes me feel depressed. Maybe that's because I'm a pessimist, but I more-so believe it's why I have been identifying more and more as a pessimist.

The book that ruined my life is "Bullshit Jobs" by David Graeber. My pitch for this book is that the author is the archetype of person I tend to disagree with. Our views don't align politically, he seemed performative (especially when talking about women), and I *really* didn't want to agree with the thesis of the book. But the more I read, the more I began to have my intuitions reaffirmed.

I'm not going to give a deep dive on the book here. If you are not familiar and/or want more context, the [essay it is based upon](https://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/) is a good refresher and will be enough for you to get the gist of what the book is about.

I grew up on computers. Specifically, Macs. According to my dad, I mostly learned to read by accidentally enabling VoiceOver and having it read stuff to me. Before I had an admin account on the family computer, I wasn't able to install anything. Back in the day, most apps and games required admin access to run their `.pkg` installer. 

When I was really bored, I would dick around in anything that was already installed on the computer. I vividly remember playing with the templates in the office applications like Pages and Numbers and thinking, "What is the point of this? Who actually uses this?". A lot of the graphs and premade documents confused me. Not that the template was useless, but the actual point of the document itself.

Who would ever need to write a letter structured like this, and why? Wouldn't two people communicating just do so naturally, like a conversation? Precompiling the information into this rigid structure seemed pointless. Unproductive. Inefficient. A waste of time.

Granted, I definitely didn't use any of these words in my head (especially since I had to spell-check the word "definitely"). Despite now being aware of the actual purpose of a letterhead, a CV or a resume, bar and pie charts, etc, looking at these templates still brings up the very same emotions I felt as a kid. Almost akin to a nostalgic, melancholy smell.

"Bullshit Jobs" reaffirmed these emotions and my skepticism towards the usefulness of the people and tasks that these templates were designed to assist. The vast majority of people don't actually do anything useful at all at their jobs. Or if they are doing something useful, it's beating around the bush of solving the actual problem. They are [duct-tapers](http://archive.today/acsqX).

Everything useful and productive, upon closer examination, makes me feel depressed. I fucking love my computer. It's awesome. But it's built with human suffering. Someone online called it "chinese slave jewelry"

What the fuck, lol?

I can't find the comment. I think it's a little extreme. Of course everything we do, consume, and enjoy is tied to some form of suffering. Human or non-human. We live on stolen land; Our ancestors did terrible things; There is no ethical consumption under capitalism.; et cetera, et cetera.

But a small part of me is drawn to its underpinnings. Despite how whiny and ineffective these mantras are, the comment *is* actually true. Most Americans (and other countries too of course) regularly participate in a system that, at the bottom, is fueled by people who are suffering and/or people trying to avoid suffering. It's just a part of life. Not just modern life, but basic biology. Entropy even.

For a system to keep operating, it must consume more than it outputs. That's essentially (my understanding of) the 2nd law of thermodynamics. It doesn't matter if you're a human, a corporation, a single-celled organism, or a star, you are bound to this restriction.

In my opinion, this fucking sucks! It doesn't absolve me of guilt, just explains why, on average, we all are hypocrites. "It's an explanation, not a justification."

Anything and everything we do must -- I'm losing my train of thought and I want to keep writing in an attempt to feel better.

Everywhere I go, everything I do, every conversation I have, every idea that pops into my head inevitably leads to thinking about this shit. I'm tired of it. I feel like can't truly enjoy anything anymore.

I can't even be genuinely altruistic anymore, because even "doing the right thing" serves my self interests. And being aware of this serves no purpose. If anything it's counterproductive.

I consider myself to be a very fortunate person. I grew up wealthy and with a supportive, healthy family. My dad is a doctor. I never have to worry about finances. He subsidizes my entire life. I am currently working my first "big boy" full-time job. All of my income is either invested or spent on non-essentials. I don't resent this. I'm quite grateful for it. The alternative would suck. I think that people who come from a less fortunate background and feel morally superior or more accomplished than their more fortunate counterparts are foolish. I get it though, it's a coping mechanism from being dealt a bad hand.

However, no one deserves anything. That's not reality. Yeah it sucks, but there's no law of the universe that enforce it. Our society tries to, but at the end of the day, we will all do whatever it takes to keep playing the game.

One thing that's been worrying me recently is being "too intelligent for my britches". I think that I'm quite good at "arguing". Not convincing the other person that I'm right, but being able to defend my position, regardless of whether it's correct or not.

I see this in my dad, and I get most of my tendencies from his genes. He's turning 67 this year. He's very intelligent and analytical. He has described himself as being "heartless at times", but I think heartless is a bad choice of words. He's an empathetic person, but if you're wrong, you're wrong, and he (usually) won't bullshit you otherwise.

Recently he's been trying to beat the market. Despite the papers I've sent him and backtests I've done for him that suggest that he's not actually expected to profit more than an index fund, he continues with his strategy. I'm not sure what causes this exactly. Ego? Hubris?

It doesn't matter. It's his money. He can do with it as he pleases. He could put all of it on red tomorrow and while I'd be concerned, he's set (/ is setting me) up well enough to not really care.

I worry that I am doing something similar. Am I really debunking my opponents, or am I merely convincing myself that they are wrong? In an attempt to mitigate this, I try to keep an open mind and play devil's advocate as much as possible. It doesn't matter if I'm right. Most of the time, you can't be "right" and making that your goal is badly defined. I think it's better to try to be less wrong. Who "won" a debate is less important than the new trains of thought that it brings you down. If you're shutting out any chance of your opponent being right, then you're missing out on their perspective.

I think everyone is "right" in their own sense. Everyone wants to do the "right" thing. Even the most evil people, usually, in some perverted way, think that what they are doing is the right thing. When I do something wrong, at the time, I feel as it's the right thing to do. My mistakes always come from good intentions. It's only from acquiring new information that I'm able to reflect on my reasoning and find the flaw in what I did and attempt to not repeat the mistake.

The quicker I can identify my biases, the quicker I can implement what I've learned from my experiences.
