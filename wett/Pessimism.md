For the record, I think being a pessimist is, for lack of a better term, "gay and stupid".

I somewhat apologize for being rash there. I don't mean to offend. I don't apologize for being honest. This sentence might be even stupider and gayer than being a pessimist.

Everything imporant makes me feel depressed. Maybe that's because I'm a pessimist, but I moreso believe it's why I have been identifying more and more as a pessimist.
