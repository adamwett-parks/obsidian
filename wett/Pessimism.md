For the record, I think being a pessimist is, for lack of a better term, "gay and stupid".

I somewhat apologize for being rash there. I don't mean to offend. I don't apologize for being honest. This sentence might be even stupider and gayer than being a pessimist.

Everything important makes me feel depressed. Maybe that's because I'm a pessimist, but I more-so believe it's why I have been identifying more and more as a pessimist.

The book that ruined my life is "Bullshit Jobs" by David Graeber. My pitch for this book is that the author is the archetype of person I tend to disagree with. Our views don't align politically, he seemed performative (especially when talking about women), and I *really* didn't want to agree with the thesis of the book. But the more I read, the more I began to have my intuitions reaffirmed.

I'm not going to give a deep dive on the book here. If you are not familiar and/or want more context, the [essay it is based upon](https://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/) is a good refresher and will be enough for you to get the gist of what the book is about.

I grew up on computers. Specifically, Macs. According to my dad, I mostly learned to read by accidentally enabling VoiceOver and having it read stuff to me. Before I had an admin account on the family computer, I wasn't able to install anything. Back in the day, most apps and games required admin access to run their `.pkg` installer. 

When I was really bored, I would dick around in anything that was already installed on the computer. I vividly remember playing with the templates in the office applications like Pages and Numbers and thinking, "What is the point of this? Who actually uses this?". A lot of the graphs and premade documents confused me. Not that the template was useless, but the actual point of the document itself.

Who would ever need to write a letter structured like this, and why? Wouldn't two people communicating just do so naturally, like a conversation? Precompiling the information into this rigid structure seemed pointless. Unproductive. Inefficient. A waste of time.

Granted, I definitely didn't use any of these words in my head (especially since I had to spell-check the word "definitely"). Despite now being aware of the actual purpose of a letterhead, a CV or a resume, bar and pie charts, etc, looking at these templates still brings up the very same emotions I felt as a kid. Almost akin to a nostalgic, melancholy smell.

"Bullshit Jobs" reaffirmed these emotions and my skepticism towards the usefulness of the people and tasks that these templates were designed to assist. The vast majority of people don't actually do anything useful at all at their jobs. Or if they are doing something useful, it's beating around the bush of solving the actual problem. They are [duct-tapers](http://archive.today/acsqX).

Everything useful and productive, upon closer examination, makes me feel depressed. I fucking love my computer. It's awesome. But it's built with human suffering. Someone online called it "chinese slave jewelry"

What the fuck, lol?

I can't find the comment. I think it's a little extreme. Of course everything we do, consume, and enjoy is tied to some form of suffering. Human or non-human. We live on stolen land; Our ancestors did terrible things; There is no ethical consumption under capitalism.; et cetera, et cetera.

But a small part of me is drawn to it's underpinnings. Despite how whiny and ineffective these mantras are, it *is* actually true. Most Americans (and other countries too of course) regularly participate in a system that, at the bottom, is fueled by people who are suffering and/or people trying to avoid suffering. It's just a part of life. Not just modern life, but basic biology. Entropy even.

For a system to keep operating, it must consume more than it outputs. That's essentially the 2nd law of thermodynamics. It doesn't matter if you're a hu
