state trials are units of park system, standalone
they may go thru another park unit, they all go thru at least one park
state park units may overlap
what is "all trails"?
no definition of a11y for trials, no label!!

use their trails layer for data
hit liver service for arcgis

small T trails in 1 layer, might be able to tell whether or not its a state trial

state trails in separate layer
MAKE SURE trail stat = "DESIGNATED"
difficulty on website / trail map is ambiugous, not on GIS

pull in info for a summary and have them tell us what they want to remove / add & then run my m&c
