### my questions
- should we explain the philosophy of what a Pre-Approval is in the app guide / procedures?
	- it seems like since we are making big changes the buof is amorphous on this
	- BUOF should write this, they never send it out to their users
	- talk to kelly about this
	- ditrcit level training never goes down
	- have a modal with a message from the BUOF to display for the first week
- should we wait to pull main on production? monday morning?
