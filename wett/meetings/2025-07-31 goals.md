## Goals

- Q1 june - august
	- getting somewhat familiar with legacy
	- learning how to use jira effectively
	- learning how to document
	- migrating passport to nextjs
	- migrating warehouse to nextjs + prisma
- Q2 august - december
	- be proficient with jira
	- have some experience with AWS (i have zero experience currently)
	- completely understand all business rules & nuances of a single legacy application
	- have this application in "beta testing" with a small subset of users
		- perhaps interface with the existing database in a way that doesn't break legacy version
- Q3 december - may
	- be proficient with AWS
	- passport shipped to production
	- have a v2 app or two being used in production
	- have designed a new application for v2 


- support
	- rev up v2
		- core v2 backend architecture was designed by alex or dr. dominguez
			- way too complex for what we need which is a low-inertia development environment, where people can start and stop working on it easily instead of having to study it (like legacy)
		- why is v2 day on fridays?
			- people are tired and don't want to work on it or leave early
		- v2 day meetings are spent nitpicking wireframes
		- ian being v2 lead has hindered progress
