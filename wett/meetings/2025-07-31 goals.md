## Goals

- Q1 june - august
	- getting somewhat familiar with legacy
	- learning how to use jira effectively
	- learning how to document
	- migrating passport to nextjs
	- migrating warehouse to nextjs + prisma
- Q2 august - december
	- be proficient with jira
	- have some experience with AWS (i have zero experience currently)
	- completely understand all business rules & nuances of a single legacy application
	- have this application in "beta testing" with a small subset of users
		- perhaps interface with the existing database in a way that doesn't break legacy version
- Q3 december - may
	- be proficient with AWS
	- passport shipped to production
	- have a v2 app or two being used in production
	- have designed a new application for v2 


- support
	- rev up v2
		- core v2 backend architecture was designed by alex or dr. dominguez
			- way too complex for what we need which is a low-inertia development environment, where people can start and stop working on it easily instead of having to study it (like legacy)
		- why is v2 day on fridays?
			- people are tired and don't want to work on it or leave early
		- v2 day meetings are spent nitpicking wireframes
		- ian being v2 lead has hindered progress

lunch & learn, presenting, youtube videos
maiking it the back of your hand
v2 day will probably changed
databse docs & app docs

look at the host of old unclosed tickets, starting from oldest forward
especially ones that have yellow 'JC', look at the app, let john know which one interests you

if theres an interest from a personal standpoint it would work well
in some apps theres somethings that got started and havent been finished

easy: how we bring in the state property office info,
state property office with DOA has adatatset of faciflitys buildings stucturs and land, that info is correlated with dept of insurance, having those assets synced with ours is very beenficial
we used to improt the SPO data but when they changed their system we stopped and its faleln to the wayside

once an asset becomes a part of the division, it goes thru entry over at DOA, then entered at SPO, then we get a memo saying its been entered. should be a simple api for us to work thru



% rules being told something, doing something,  being able to teach
