## AMU meeting
- no more batch approvals, but we need a way for people to see exisiting requests that have not been fully approved yet
- ideas:
  - mahnaz: pin unapproved requests to the top of the current requests page
  - mahnaz: based on PCard recons, in unit buttons, it should say how many recons they have that are still pending
  - mahnaz: make
  - cole: small component for # of preapprovals you can do that are pending from previous weeks
- add sort & filtering card to the top of the page
  - filtering should be a URL param since it modifies the query
  - sorting should be in javascript since it's with the same data
