### Last Week
- [PA-1506] pcard_recon AMU is "INCORRECT" despite center table entry
  - Caused by overly aggressive check for non-4600 AMUs
  - Duct tape: Add exception for an additional budget fund
  - Fix: Refactor into gateway class with lots of comments
- [PA-1386] ParkUnits & Divper Gateway Classes (merged)
  - Lots of useful functions in here, spiritual successor to `get_parkcodes_dist.php`
- [V2-227] New V2 repo "Hellbender"
  - Current V2 repo has an exceedingly large & mostly irrelevant history
  - Created a new Next app from scratch, migrated Portal & refactored for SSR
  - Started migrating David's Calendar
  - Currently using SQL strings similar to legacy, experimenting with aligning Prisma with current V2 tables
### This Week
- Work on PARs User Guide (focusing on Advanced Sort Options)
- Assist with PARs user testing
- Finish migrating David's Calendar
- Continue investigating whether to use mysql2 or Prisma
