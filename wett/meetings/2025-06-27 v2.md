# Jira
- UI standards in Jira
  - Write decision making process down
  - Document enough so someone could pick it up and know where you were at
  - Tangent:
    - Similar process for PA, and all other docs
    - Background, research, plan, testing
  - Header: V2-157
    - Left off at making wireframes, still need to implement
    - Jake?: logo click -> portal, app home is in sidebar
- Jira explainer
  - Epic
    - variety of work items
    - eg. UI standard, nextjs migrations
    - "epics last longer than 1 sprint" (we dont do sprints here)
    - useful for categorizing work to see general progress
    - useful for going back to stuff done in the past
  - Work item types
    - bug:
    - docs: document something, not trying to do any code changes
    - task: something simple, used in ticket board a lot
    - subtask: breaking items down, used a lot in aix, makes it easier to avoid overlapping work
  - Feel free to ask more Jira questions
  - Jake?: everything we do should be in Jira
  - Time tracking is useful but hard to keep up with
  - John can use it to show how we need staff to do our jobs
  - Tracking work:
    - Edit description
      - Good for Jira search (Jira ignores comments)
    - Editing comments
      - Searchable with JQL
      - Shows timeline of progress
    - Work description
      - Don't use for anything ephemeral, not good for docs
      - Used for justifiying time but VERY optional, not really looked at or used regardless
      - Anything that's revelant to the item should be in comments or desc
  - Tickets
    - Small tasks
      - Keep on ticket board
      - Don't edit description, use comments
      - Internal notes: only for team
      - Reply to customer: visible in portal & customer gets an email
      - Needed code or db work? 
        - Change work type to bug or feature
        - This will automatically make a PA and relate it (link it) to the ticket
        - Doc
          - Document how it currently works
          - Specify the problem
          - Explain how to solve
          - Testing
  - Be clear and concise
  - More info:
    - Sharepoint site for Jira
    - Documentation SOPs
    - But do ask more questions
