## Cathy
- DB access levels
  - first they use the template
  - if they checked the box that they talked to their manager & added mgr to ticket then OK
  - use common sense and avoid blanket auths:
    - OA asking for fire management
    - ticking every box on the form
  - look up ticket for previous person of that park
  - put more effort into non-standard request
  - if ur not sure, ask team member

## Benson
