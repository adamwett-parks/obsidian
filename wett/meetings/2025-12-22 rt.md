## Eric's address
- as we come out of the holiday season, there's some things going on outside of DPR where we are looking at teleworking schedules
- looking for a couple cubes, filled a couple FTE positions, make sure we aren't giving away space that we're using
- anticipating that John will be back Jan 1st
- please loop eric in on 
- push by the dept to not do a lot of teleworking anymore
- presence is best, trying to not cut positions but also has to justify that cube is occupied
- eric might start start helping cathy with admin stuff
- intentionally trying to focus a lot on V2 this next year
- CC Eric on requests for remote work
