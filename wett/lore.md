- LORE : the first 2 letters of the first 2 words was what Tom started with for the abbreviations
- ...more LORE : I believe that he got the idea from the National Parks Service....back in the dayâ€¦..he has mentioned the origins...I just can't remember
- LORE: in the past Tom would make changes as requested by people using the apps...whether they were the owner, or not....Tony built all the MC modules/app to make HIS life easier, so he was pretty much the owner...with one foot in the BUOF and one foot in the programmer realm.... That has all changed with Tony's retirement...and there is no one left in the BUOF that knows (or wants to know) the LORE... and now, in Tom's 'realm' there are more people using the apps that are more computer savvy, finding things that are not working correctly or the way that THEY want....however, the problem comes when 1 person wants to change the app behavior for themself, but they do not consider that there are 40+ parks using that same app...and changing the way it works for them, will change it for everyone else...and that might not be the BEST solution.... and also...a lot of the workflows for how things are done at the parks, in the budget office, everywhere... are not written down and not being passed down (word-of-mouth), so the new people are just doing the best they can and/or making it up as they go....
