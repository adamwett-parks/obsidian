Looking back on our project to optimize the lubrication system, I realize my most significant contributions weren't just in the technical calculations, but in navigating the human elements of teamwork. I found my most crucial role was acting as a mediator during our technical debates. Things can get stuck when working on a team on a project like this. I made it my goal to step back and listen to every perspective from my teammates and help guide us toward a consensus that combined the best from all our ideas. My strategy is about making sure we were arguing for the project and not just for our own concepts. This is what I believe made our final design so much stronger. In addition, there was the logistical challenge of the time difference.

I definitely exhibited several behaviors that initially hindered team productivity. My geographical isolation in Colorado, combined with my full-time work schedule had created significant scheduling conflicts that frustrated my teammates. I often had to miss impromptu meetings or could only attend during unconventional hours, which disrupted the team's natural workflow and momentum. My communication style suffered due to time constraints. I sometimes provided  rushed feedback or delayed responses to important discussions. My asynchronous participation made it difficult for us to progress cohesively as a team. 

Based on my experience wrestling with time zones and communication barriers on this lubrication system project, I've come to believe that international teams need fundamentally different organizational structures than groups that work together in physical proximity. The biggest revelation for me was that we can't just transplant traditional meeting-heavy workflows across continents. Teams should organize around documentation as the primary communication method, with synchronous meetings kept to a minimum as checkpoints rather than the main decision-making vehicle. Our most productive periods came when we shifted to detailed written updates and structured decision logs that everyone could contribute to on their own schedule. I'd recommend establishing cultural communication bridges. I can see rotating who facilitates discussions, or having structured formats where everyone presents their perspective before any critique begins being quite productive. This prevents dominant communication styles from steamrolling others. The time zone issue taught me that traditional project management falls apart when you can't rely on real-time coordination. Teams should organize with redundant expertise across time zones and not just rely one person mastering their own technical area, but ensuring critical knowledge spans across multiple regions. When I couldn't attend those impromptu problem-solving sessions, having teammates who understood my contributions well enough to represent them made a huge difference.

The challenges I faced collaborating from Colorado while my teammates were in South Carolina turned out to be an unexpected training ground for international teamwork. Living two hours behind and juggling a full-time job forced me to develop skills that directly translate to global collaboration. I learned that asynchronous communication isn't just a backup plan. Often it's the primary mode when you're spanning continents. Those rushed messages I initially sent taught me the hard way that written communication needs to be comprehensive and crystal clear when you can't just pop by someone's desk to clarify. I started documenting my technical reasoning more thoroughly, creating decision logs that teammates could reference regardless of when they logged in. This shift from verbal to written-first, highly technical communication is exactly what international teams rely on. The technical disagreements we navigated also prepared me for the cultural dimensions of global work. My tendency to jump straight into critiquing proposals, which created friction even within our purely American team, made me realize how much more nuanced this becomes across cultures. Some people you work with might value harmony over direct confrontation, while others expect a technical debate. I learned to pause, listen fully, and understand the context behind proposals before challenging them. This patience will be crucial when working with international colleagues who bring different problem-solving philosophies to the table. Perhaps most importantly, the scheduling nightmare of balancing my work schedule with team meetings taught me to be proactive rather than reactive. International teams can't rely on spontaneous collaboration.  The isolation I felt being physically separated from my team mirrors what remote international collaborators experience daily. It pushed me to over-communicate, to be more intentional about relationship building, and to find creative ways to stay connected beyond just project deliverables. These soft skills matter just as much as the technical ones when your teammates are halfway around the world.
