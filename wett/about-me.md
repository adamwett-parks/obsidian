Hi, I'm Adam!

I was first introduced to the team while completing my NC State Senior Design project for the Division.
My task was to create a Digital Passport for the State Parks. This June, I joined the Division as a temporary employee.
Since I began working I have been improving the functionality of the Digital Passport and I am currently overseeing a Senior Design team, who are expanding upon the functionality and accessibility of the initial Digital Passport. I am also helping the team enhance and modernize our exisiting application suite. 

As a kid I have always been drawn to fixing problems using computers & code, so my role here has been a great experience so far. Outside of work, I frequently work on side projects. But, when I'm not in front of a screen, you can find me hanging out with friends and savoring my last semester in college.
