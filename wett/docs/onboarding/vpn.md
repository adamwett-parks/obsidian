# VPN
The VPN into the State Network is how you access the servers to run your code. You can connect to the VPN using the Cisco AnyConnect client.

## Nuances
- Make sure you select "91-Admin 2FA" in the dropdown when connecting
- WSL will not be able to connect to the internet while you're connected to the VPN.
