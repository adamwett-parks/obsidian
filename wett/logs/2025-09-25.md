I appreciate your patience with me this week :) I know I haven't been my usual self...

I skipped class this week because resistance is futile without my meds. I'm very excited to see the classes in PA-1327 being expanded upon for the AMU project. Props to Cole for spending so much time meeting with me and doing detailed code reviews. He's a great mentor and I enjoy working with him.

Let me know if this is detailed enough or if I should be more diligent in my logs.

Thanks,
Adam Wettreich
