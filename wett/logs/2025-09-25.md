i appreciate your patience with me this week :) i know i haven't been my usual self...
i skipped class today because resistance is futile without my meds
i'm very excited to see the classes in PA-1327 being expanded upon for the AMU 

- start: 8:10am
- finish: 4:10pm
- v2 warehouse
	- docker woes
	- implemented add to cart
	- implemented remove from cart
	- backend bug: updating item quantity doesn't work as expected
- amu update
	- [PA-1404]
		- added AMU class
		- added readme for `_global` with syntax example
		- replaced a few hardcoded AMUs
	- [PA-1434] new requests page
		- 30 min meeting
		- refactored logic & overrides into class
- went back and logged some stuff in Jira time tracking
- logged time in Fiori

let me know if this is detailed enough or if i should be more diligent in my remote logs

thanks,
Adam
