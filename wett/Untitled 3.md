my thoughts:

- our goal rn is to make it as best as possible for the students by the time we have to submit everything
- SDC staff isn't going to be able to run our code
- bc of this we should focus on docs over UI polish since it will help them the most
- any features that aren't working fully we can have the students do OR we can give them a "patch" to apply
